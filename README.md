# Financial Risk Detection Project

## Introduction

This project aims to conduct risk analysis for loan default prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning, the goal is to identify patterns and factors influencing loan default.

## Business Objectives

- Identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in repaying loans through detailed analysis of application data.
- Determine key demographic, financial, and credit-related factors influencing loan default using machine learning models.
- Utilize insights to inform portfolio management, risk assessment, and lending practices.
- Develop strategies to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults and optimize lending decisions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the CSV files for application data and previous loan applications.
- `code/`: Folder containing Python scripts for data analysis and machine learning.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview, objectives, and instructions for running the code.
